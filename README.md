# Fortune500
I am building a tool that will find the number of technology jobs availabile for each Fortune 500 company. I will collect this information and store it in a Google spreadsheet.


Timeline:

Sprint #1:
Import all packages and libraries needed to parse through a website
Test run through Walmart's website and print the number of technology jobs offered last year

Sprint #2:
Go through multiple companies and print the number of tech jobs offered last year

Sprint #3:
Connect the data found to Google spreadsheet
